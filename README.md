# easy-debmirror
Ever wanted to build a custom debian iso but your shitty internet speed got you more annoyed than a karen who is denied to see the manager?
Well this is for you, waste bandwith now with this new, impressive, not at all short and cheap script to mirror debian.
This awesome software comes bundled with all the messy options you could want to run debmirror for os building purposes;
like: including the dep-11 files, making a checksum of every file in the repo so you can slowly break your HDD and finally have an excuse to ask your parents for a larger one.
And the best of all, it's free for use and modification!, download and WASTE BANDWITH NOW!
